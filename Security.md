# **AWS Live Call Analytics Security**

## **Summary**

This document provides a compiled list of security controls and best practices for the AWS [Live Call Analytics](https://amazon.com/live-call-analytics) (LCA) solution.

## **Solution Overview**

LCA is an open source solution used to transcribe and analyze contact center calls in real-time. It helps contact center supervisors and agents to improve callers' experience, boost agent productivity, and gain conversation insights by adding artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to the contact center.

LCA is distributed as a fully packaged and secure solution that can be deployed in your AWS account using AWS CloudFormation. The solution does most of the heavy lifting associated with providing an end-to-end system that can plug into your contact center and provide insights in real-time. This includes components to ingest call audio, perform streaming transcriptions, enrich transcriptions with machine learning (e.g. sentiment analytics) and create call recording. The solution provides an interface via a web application and an API.

The LCA solution is published in a public GitHub [repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-transcribe-live-call-analytics) which allows you to review the code and infrastructure configuration that is deployed in your AWS account. The diagram below shows the main architectural components and how they fit together at a high level. Numbered connections depict communication between services used in the architecture.

## **Controls and Options**

The table below describes the security controls implemented by the LCA solution. The LCA solution is designed with security best practices in mind. However, the security of its implementation can differ based on your specific use case and adding additional security measures can have additional costs. In addition to the security controls included out of the box, the following table also describes options to enhance the security posture of LCA in production environments.

| Network Access Control & Isolation         | <p>**Call Ingestion (0)**</p><p>The LCA solution uses AmazonAmazon Chime SDK Voice Connector to ingest phone call audio from your on-premises Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs) and Session Border Controllers (SBCs) using the SIPREC protocol.</p><p></p><p>AmazonAmazon Chime SDK Voice Connector is a regional managed service (currently in the us-east-1 and us-west-2 regions). When you deploy it in your AWS account, it creates an endpoint with a unique hostname that is accessible over the public Internet. Your SBC or telephony systems are configured to establish a SIPREC trunk that sends a copy of your contact center calls to this endpoint.</p><p></p><p>Configuration Options:</p><p>The AmazonAmazon Chime SDK Voice Connector endpoint supports TLS to encrypt the SIPREC signaling and SRTP to encrypt media streams. It is strongly recommended to use encryption with yourAmazon Chime SDK Voice Connector endpoint. When you configure it to use TLS and SRTP encryption, the endpoint rejects unencrypted connections. You can configure an allow-list to only permit connections from your IP addresses. The destination IP address ranges and ports are documented in the AmazonAmazon Chime SDK Voice Connector [Network configuration page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/network-config.html#cvc).</p><p></p><p>**User Interface and API (16)**</p><p>Agents and supervisors from your contact center can connect to a web application to view details of calls completed or in-progress. The web application is downloaded from an Amazon CloudFront distribution created in your account. The web application uses a GraphQL API provided by the AWS AppSync service. The web application provides links to audio recordings from an Amazon S3 bucket in your account.</p><p></p><p>The hostnames of the CloudFront distribution, AppSync API and the recording S3 bucket are unique to your AWS account. You can enable access to those specific hostnames from the agent’s/supervisor’s machines.</p><p></p><p>Configuration Options:</p><p>Amazon CloudFront can restrict access to specific geographical regions. Additionally, for the Amazon CloudFront web distribution and/or AWS AppSync API, you can use AWS WAF to protect against attacks and restrict access by IP addresses. Access to the S3 recording bucket can be restricted to your IP addresses using a bucket policy. See:</p><p>[Use CloudFront geo restriction to restrict access from geographic regions](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-geo-restriction/) and [Limit Amazon S3 bucket access to certain IPs or VPCs](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/block-s3-traffic-vpc-ip/)</p><p></p><p>You can also use custom hostnames for the web app URL distributed via Amazon CloudFront and the Amazon API if you prefer using your own DNS domains. See: [Using custom URLs by adding alternate domain names ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html)and [Configuring custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/custom-domain-name.html).</p><p></p> |
| <p>Inter-network traffic</p><p>privacy</p> | <p>The LCA solution use integrations between AWS Services. </p><p>AWS services operate in secure segregated networks accessed only via defined service endpoints over HTTPS/port 443, and enforce encryption, authentication, and authorization policies. </p><p>For information on IP ranges by service, see: [ aws ip ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html).</p><p>For information on security and compliance of AWS infrastructure, see:</p><p>- [AWS Infrastructure Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-aws-security/security-of-the-aws-infrastructure.html) </p><p>- [Security documentation by service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/?secd_intro2) – eg: [DynamboDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/security.html)<br> </p><p>Inter-service communications used by the LCA solution are indicated and numbered on the LCA architecture diagram above. In each case, connections between services, including connections to data storage services - Amazon DynamoDB (6,14), Amazon S3 (8,15), Amazon Kinesis (1,2,9,10) - are routed within the Amazon managed network infrastructure to the associated service endpoint which allows access to the target service only if the requests are encrypted using TLS with ephemeral keys associated with valid IAM roles and policies (See Identity and Access Management below). </p><p></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Identity and access management             | <p>The AWS services used by the LCA solution use AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM) to manage authentication and authorization.</p><p><br>The LCA solution implements IAM roles with least privilege policies to provide the minimally required permissions between components. AWS API requests between components are authenticated using temporary credentials and using the AWS [Signature Version 4 signing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).</p><p></p><p>The S3 buckets provisioned by the solution are configured with public access blocked to prevent accidental unauthenticated data exposure.</p><p></p><p>Access to the web application and the AppSync API is secured using an Amazon Cognito user pool. This user pool allows you to create users that are allowed to sign in to the application. After successfully authenticating a user, Amazon Cognito issues JSON web tokens (JWT) that is used to secure and authorize access to the AppSync APIs, or exchange for temporary AWS credentials</p><p></p><p>Configuration Options:</p><p>You can use AWS IAM to manage administrative access to AWS resources services from the AWS Console or via API requests. See: [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html).</p><p></p><p>You can enable multi factor authentication (MFA) in the Amazon Cognito user pool. See: [Adding MFA to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html).</p><p></p><p>You can use Amazon Cognito to federate with your existing identity providers to provide single sign on (SSO).

## **Shared Security Model**

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security *of* the cloud and security *in* the cloud:

- **Security of the cloud** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. The effectiveness of our security is regularly tested and verified by third-party auditors as part of the [AWS compliance programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/). To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS services, see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)
- **Security in the cloud** – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS services that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your organization’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.

For best practices see the [Security, Identity & Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/security-identity-compliance/?cards-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&cards-all.sort-order=desc&awsf.content-type=*all&awsf.methodology=*all) section of the AWS Architecture Center. For additional AWS security, compliance, penetration testing, Security Bulletins, resources, etc., please visit the [AWS Cloud Security website](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).

## **Data Privacy**

The LCA solution is deployed in your AWS accounts. As a customer, you maintain ownership of your content, and you select which AWS services can process, store, and host your content. AWS does not access or use your content for any purpose without your agreement. AWS never uses customer content or derive information from it for marketing or advertising. For details, see [AWS Data Privacy](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/)
