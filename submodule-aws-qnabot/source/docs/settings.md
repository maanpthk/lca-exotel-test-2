When enabled, QnABot uses Kendra Retrieve api to retrieve semantically relevant passages of up to 200 token words from the documents (not FAQs) in your index. When disabled, QnAbot use Kendra Query to retrieve shorter passages or answers. Takes effect only when LLM_QA_ENABLE is true. The default is true (recommended) when LLM QA is enabled.

| LLM_CHAT_HISTORY_MAX_MESSAGES            | Positive integer  | Specifies the maximum number of previous messages maintained in the QnABot DynamoDB UserTable for conversational context and follow-up question disambiguation.         |
| LLM_PROMPT_MAX_TOKEN_LIMIT               | Positive integer  | Specifies the maximum number of tokens in the prompt message that can be sent to the LLM. QnABot will selectively truncate the prompt by history and context to shorten the total length. |
